With my coming darkness shall begone. All evil is cleansed with my holy light, post blessed by the people. Power is the one true way to create a perfect, utopian society. I have power, fear me. Carter of the red programming legion. And I. Am. Legend."

		Backstory of Romario and Carter

	<h2 class="backstorytext">
		Some of you might be wondering: how in the world did Carter and Romario meet? Let us inform you on your important question. Last year, Carter and Romario both enrolled into the League of DVC, not realizing each other's existence. It was at this day where Carter and Romario would meet. They created a bond at a fast rate that would seal a great friendship, until the day of Enlightenment. The day of Enlightenment was the first time in history Carter and Romario came across a subject more captivating than anything, more powerful than anything they had ever seen. What was that subject, you might ask? The subject was Programming with HTML and CSS. At this very day, Carter and Romario knew that they had to be better than each other. WHICH IS WHY THEY BECAME ULTIMATE RIVALS OF CODING! Romario and Carter then set out in a journey to create an organization where Master Coders, such as themselves, can live but compete in the Presidential Master Coder Election of 2018.
