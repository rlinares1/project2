			<h2>
				Why I am a better Coder than Carter
			</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="six5">
			<p>
				Carter wishes he could be a better Master Coder, such as myself. However, Carter possesses nothing that deserves him to be a Master Coder. Even though Carter has made a Plants vs Zombies game, and a Factorio calculator using JavaScript, they all prove to be useless and barely work and he never uses them ever again. With me, I made a discord Bot that deletes spam messages, removes swear words, and so much more. Note that I actually coded the discord bot using Python and C#, something Carter could never learn. Carter is actually very lazy and never helps anyone out. With me, I actually bring new content to the community and listen to what they want. With me, I can code something that works and something that I use to help the community. That is something Carter could never do.
