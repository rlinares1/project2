			<h2>
				Before voting, make sure you are confident in who you want to vote for. Make sure you know everything about the person you're voting for and why you are voting for that person over the other person. You need to be truthful and take this election seriously. If you do not take this election seriously, you are violating the Terms and Services of this election, and your vote will no longer be counted.

			<h2>
				Now that you have thought about who you want to vote for, simply click one of our images to vote. It will direct you to a page about one of us, and why we are far more superior than our opposing candidate. Under the page, there will be a call to action link. This is how you know, you are heading towards the final step. Remember, you can only vote for one of us once. A misuse of voting will result in severe punishment for violating the Terms and Services of this election.

			<h1>
				Step 3
			</h1>
		<div class="text3">
			<h2>
				You have finally reached the final stage on how to vote for one of the candidates provided to you. When you click on Romario's or Carter's picture, you will be directed to a screen why we are far more superior than our opposing candidate and why we are a better leader than each other. This was mentioned previously in Step 2. When you scroll below the tab there will be a Call To Action link that will take you to another site. With this, you will proceed to do the actions listed on the site to make sure our communities: THE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF MASTER CODERS, and the COALITION OF DETERMINED CODERS deserve justice and righteousness in our system.
